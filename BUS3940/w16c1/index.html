					&ldquo;Although the native people admitted Europeans to their lands, they approached these visitors cautiously. <emx>Two generations of continuous slaving had left a strong legacy of distrust for foreigners</emx>. The Jesuits moved freely among the Indians but encountered little enthusiasm for conversion or congregation among them. Despite this lack of cooperation, their efforts were not in vain. For six months the three missionaries lived in the principal Moxo village, gaining the confidence of the native people and learning to survive in an alien environment.&rdquo;

						"Spaniards based in Cuzco launched three major thrusts toward Moxos between 1536 and 1567; and lesser parties left Cochabamba and La Paz during the same period. Although none of the Andean&mdash;based bands actually reached the savanna, these early operations established the Viceroyalty of Peru's legal claim to the realm of the Gran Moxo, wherever it might prove to lie." (28)
						
						"As enthusiasm for pursuit of the Gran Moxo waned, European contact with Moxos entered a new phase. Beginning in the mid­seventeenth century, members of the Society of Jesus began a period of residence among the native peoples that ended only with Jesuit exile in 1767." (33)

						Importantly, this view of “the temporality of landscape” situates archaeology and ethnography as forms of dwelling in the landscape, and thus moves us away from the narrow view that archaeology merely deals with “dead persons,” objects without subjectivity, or as Giddens (1984: 357) quips, the “bric-a-brac washed up on the shore of modern times and left there as the social currents within which it was created have drained away.”

							&ldquo;Most readers make three false assumptions when addressing an unfamiliar poem. The first is assuming that they should understand what they encounter on the first reading, and if they don’t, that something is wrong with them or with the poem. The second is assuming that the poem is a kind of code, that each detail corresponds to one, and only one, thing, and unless they can crack this code, they’ve missed the point. The third is assuming that the poem can mean anything readers want it to mean.&rdquo;

						&ldquo;Herons&rdquo;
					
						The fishermen who scale and gut their catch discover a river in the bellies of the fish.
					
						In the river shines a sandbar where some boys play soccer.
					
						A few herons come to the beach, take off their feathers, and go for a swim.
					
						The fishermen wink at the boys goading them to bathe with the herons.
					
						But the boys prefer to hide the herons’ clothes.
					
						Then the fishermen who scale and gut their fish laugh so hard they fall down, choking.
					
						The herons dress themselves in the fish scales and dive into the river.

						<b>Indigenous Identity</b>
						
						Identity, it is not in my hair  
						It is not in my face  
						Reflecting in the mirror.  
						Identity is not something to see,  
						It has no form, it has no color  
						But delicate like a flower it is  
						Identity lies within the speaking force  
						In the profundity of a look  
						In the singularity of my place  
						Identity is open hands and share  
						Feel the earth’s echoes and Love and peace at heart.  
						Identity is open arms and receive  
						The brotherly affirmation.  
						Identity is Union!

						MY HOME
						
						The Portuguese language is not my home.  
						No language is a home.  
						My home is the soft and viscous land where I was born  
						and the waft of the wind in Maceió.  
						It is the crabs scurrying through the muck of mangrove swamps  
						and the ocean whose waves still wet my feet when I dream.  
						My home is bats hanging from the ceiling of churches in decay,  
						madmen dancing at sunset in the asylum by the sea,  
						and the sky curved round by constellations.  
						My home is the sound of the ship’s horn  
						and the lighthouse high on the hill.  
						My home is the beggar’s hand in radiant morning.  
						And the rotting shipyards  
						(...)

						(...)  
						and the graves by the sea where my ancestors, consumptive  
						and malarial, can’t stop coughing and trembling on cold nights  
						and the smell of sugar in warehouses along the wharves  
						and mullets struggling in the fishermen’s nets  
						and strands of onions tangled in the dark  
						and rain falling over the fish pens.  
						The language I use is not and never was my home.  
						No deceitful language is a home.  
						It merely serves for me to celebrate my great impoverished silent land,  
						my dysentery-ridden toothless home, devoid of grammar books and dictionaries,  
						this land, my home, without language, without words.
