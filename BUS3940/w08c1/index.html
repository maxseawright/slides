						&ldquo;Most readers make three false assumptions when addressing an unfamiliar poem. The first is assuming that they should understand what they encounter on the first reading, and if they don’t, that something is wrong with them or with the poem. The second is assuming that the poem is a kind of code, that each detail corresponds to one, and only one, thing, and unless they can crack this code, they’ve missed the point. The third is assuming that the poem can mean anything readers want it to mean.&rdquo;

					&ldquo;Herons&rdquo;
					
					The fishermen who scale and gut their catch discover a river in the bellies of the fish.
					
					In the river shines a sandbar where some boys play soccer.
					
					A few herons come to the beach, take off their feathers, and go for a swim.
					
					The fishermen wink at the boys goading them to bathe with the herons.
					
					But the boys prefer to hide the herons’ clothes.
					
					Then the fishermen who scale and gut their fish laugh so hard they fall down, choking.
					
					The herons dress themselves in the fish scales and dive into the river.

					&ldquo;Clouds&rdquo;
					
					My father came to live in the Amazon to teach the Indians how to make puzzles from clouds.

					To help him, every afternoon, my brother and I ran after the idle clouds passing by up there.

					The clouds appeared and disappeared like thoughts.
					
					Near our house many Indians lined up to piece together puzzles from the clouds they know best.
					
					Here some clouds look like trees, others remind people of Pirarucú fish.
					
					Elsewhere, the Indians were looking for a cloud to complete the head of an armadillo.
					
					“With water from the rivers and with city games,” my father writes to his friends, “our Indians are entertained and learn to think.”
					
					My brother and I would rather the clouds turned into meringues so we could eat them with milk at suppertime.

					&ldquo;Game&rdquo;
					
					*for George Auzenne, in memoriam*
					
					The sister and brother, mountain and sea, play tug-of-war with the river that joins them.
					
					One day the sea jerks on the mountain, and the mountain turns over spilling her cauldron of lava over the land, houses, and people.
					
					But when the sea least expects it, the mountain pulls at the river and the sea drowns hundreds of animals and fishermen who live on the shore.
					
					“Worst of all, the biggest river allows this foolishness,” says an old woman.
					
					The people beg the universe and the stars to teach this pair of scoundrels some manners.
					
					The universe and stars say they don’t want to meddle in family affairs.

					&ldquo;Girl&rdquo;
					
					A girl who bathes in a river ends up falling in love with the river.
					
					Her parents would like her to wed an automobile; better find her another husband, get her away from that river.
					
					“This affair with the river could make others in the universe uncomfortable,” some say.
					
					The wind and other famous personalities are upset. They go on the radio and are seen on television.
					
					This sad sun who comes to greet the girl every morning with a crate of oranges is upset.
					
					The cloud who tries to slip through her window to take her far away is furious.
					
					But the girl disappears, nobody knows to where, in the arms of her river.

					&ldquo;Tree&rdquo;
					
					A man in love with a tree goes to live with it for awhile before getting married.
					
					“Now you no longer need to look for sunshine, water, or food,” the man’s friends tell him.
					
					Every night the man combs the tree’s hair and later they sit down to tea with their friends, the planets and the closest stars.
					
					Life and the environmental magazines tell their love story to the whole world.
					
					But one day the man gets tired of seeing the same faces, the same sun, moon and stars.
					
					Relatives, ecologists and their best friends, the stars, come and ask him   why he doesn’t want to live with the tree anymore.
					
					The man tells them that he’s been thinking of marrying a river, or a cloud, or something more versatile.

					&ldquo;Little Farm&rdquo;
					
					The little farm has coffee and comes out to greet the morning wearing her flower-tobacco leaf-banana-pineapple hat.
					
					(Millions of years ago, the stars and planets purchased their tickets to see her smile at this moment.)
					
					Hand in hand, noon and afternoon come out to behold and praise her.
					
					Clouds tell their kids, thunder and lightning, to stop playing hide-and-seek to come and admire the little farm.
					
					The tobacco philosopher, born on the farm, says with his leaves: “There’s nothing better than to be here at this moment on the farm.”
					
					The little farm cries tears of joy and imagines that the lightning bolts will capture this moment in a photograph.

					&ldquo;The Wait&rdquo;
					
					He who waits watches the landscape through the window for the one who is not coming.
					
					He who is not coming can be seen very well in the distance. He can be seen in a solitary boat, in the sky, in the clouds.
					
					Two trees stretch their branches to toast the day’s success.
					
					He who waits would be happy if the sun coming into the living room would decide to turn into the one who is coming.
					
					He who is not coming rides by on the back of a fly without saying hello.
					
					He who waits would like the solitary boat and the clouds to worry.
					
					It wouldn’t be bad if the trees showed a little concern, too.
