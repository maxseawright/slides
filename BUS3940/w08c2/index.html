						&ldquo;Postcolonial (often &lsquo;post-colonial&rsquo;) studies deal with the effects of colonization on cultures and societies. Unlike <em>colonialism</em>, the term <em>postcolonialism</em> is of recent provenance, emerging in the late 1970s to describe a range of literary and cultural analyses of colonized and formerly colonized societies...&rdquo;

However, from the late 1970s, &lsquo;postcolonial studies&rsquo; has referred to the analysis by cultural critics of the various social, political, and cultural effects of colonization...&rdquo;

						Antiguan-American author whose "Talk of the Town" pieces in <em>The New Yorker</em> earned her a lot of attention. Henry Louis Gates, Jr said , "She never feels the necessity of claiming the existence of a black world or a female sensibility. She assumes them both. I think it's a distinct departure that she's making, and I think that more and more black American writers will assume their world the way that she does. So that we can get beyond the large theme of racism and get to the deeper themes of how black people love and cry and live and die. Which, after all, is what art is all about." (NYT "Through West Indian Eyes" 1990).

					MY HOME
					
					The Portuguese language is not my home.  
					No language is a home.  
					My home is the soft and viscous land where I was born  
					and the waft of the wind in Maceió.  
					It is the crabs scurrying through the muck of mangrove swamps  
					and the ocean whose waves still wet my feet when I dream.  
					My home is bats hanging from the ceiling of churches in decay,  
					madmen dancing at sunset in the asylum by the sea,  
					and the sky curved round by constellations.  
					My home is the sound of the ship’s horn  
					and the lighthouse high on the hill.  
					My home is the beggar’s hand in radiant morning.  
					And the rotting shipyards  
					(...)

					(...)  
					and the graves by the sea where my ancestors, consumptive  
					and malarial, can’t stop coughing and trembling on cold nights  
					and the smell of sugar in warehouses along the wharves  
					and mullets struggling in the fishermen’s nets  
					and strands of onions tangled in the dark  
					and rain falling over the fish pens.  
					The language I use is not and never was my home.  
					No deceitful language is a home.  
					It merely serves for me to celebrate my great impoverished silent land,  
					my dysentery-ridden toothless home, devoid of grammar books and dictionaries,  
					this land, my home, without language, without words.

					<b>Indigenous Identity</b>
					
					Identity, it is not in my hair  
					It is not in my face  
					Reflecting in the mirror.  
					Identity is not something to see,  
					It has no form, it has no color  
					But delicate like a flower it is  
					Identity lies within the speaking force  
					In the profundity of a look  
					In the singularity of my place  
					Identity is open hands and share  
					Feel the earth’s echoes and Love and peace at heart.  
					Identity is open arms and receive  
					The brotherly affirmation.  
					Identity is Union!

					when you spread them
					
					or the sky you saw shining in it  
					fragments and suddenly is gone
					
					yet I am surprised to see  
					this cosmos on a page before me
					
					words stainless, transparent  
					saved from a brain full of doubts

					thoughts clothed again in language  
					expression of the human heart  
					blood all pure in our body
					
					big words are a threat to poetry  
					they have no depth nor value
					
					but children still speak free from care  
					fearless, they hold my hand
					
					they wake me from my stupor  
					uninhibited, passionate, fiery  
					they lend my heart a new rhythm
					
					in a dream I kiss their eyes  
					I'm ripening with them
					
					with them I taste purity, friendship  
					a fruit of trust and love

					&ldquo;Tree&rdquo;
					
					A man in love with a tree goes to live with it for awhile before getting married.
					
					“Now you no longer need to look for sunshine, water, or food,” the man’s friends tell him.
					
					Every night the man combs the tree’s hair and later they sit down to tea with their friends, the planets and the closest stars.
					
					Life and the environmental magazines tell their love story to the whole world.
					
					But one day the man gets tired of seeing the same faces, the same sun, moon and stars.
					
					Relatives, ecologists and their best friends, the stars, come and ask him   why he doesn’t want to live with the tree anymore.
					
					The man tells them that he’s been thinking of marrying a river, or a cloud, or something more versatile.
