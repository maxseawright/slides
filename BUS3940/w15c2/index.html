					<p>&ldquo;The definition of what constitutes TKUP is a little more problematic. TKUP is generally defined in very broad terms. It encompasses a diverse range of tradition-based innovations and creations arising from intellectual activity in the industrial, literary, or artistic fields of indigenous and traditional peoples. Its range includes agricultural products, the medicinal use of plants, and spiritual worldview. TKUP is not a monolithic entity; rather, it is diverse and sophisticated.&rdquo;</p>

					<h3>&ldquo;relationship between TKUP and patents&rdquo;</h3>
					<p>&ldquo;This heated debate has been conducted within the context of a growing belief by Third World states, scholars, and their sympathizers in the industrialized world that there is an overwhelming asymmetry in the way major intellectual property systems – especially patents – protect the intellectual property of the industrialized countries while ignoring, and in some cases appropriating, the intellectual creations of Third World peoples and cultures.&rdquo;</p>

					<p>&ldquo;In order to arrive at a definition of biopiracy one must appreciate the historical context within which the term arose. First, Western intellectual property owners have often accused Third World states and economic actors of “pirating” or unlawfully “appropriating” the intellectual property rights of industrialized entities, especially patents and copyrights.&rdquo;</p>

					<p>&ldquo;Such an argument is untenable. As I have shown elsewhere, states have always had the inherent right to control legal access to resources, including plant resources, within their territorial domains. Therefore, <emx>it is not of any importance whether the theft/appropriation of the biocultural resource in question occurred prior to or after the Convention of Biological Diversity came into effect.</emx>&rdquo;</p>

					<p>&ldquo;The 1993 Convention on Biological Diversity and 1995 Agreement on Trade Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights both have regulations that should allow for greater dialogue between the different corporations, the Brazilian government, and the indigenous groups, but <emx>they haven’t been implemented in Brazil by an international or domestic organization powerful enough or willing to maintain the regulations</emx> (Sampath, 2005). The effectiveness of these measures has been hampered by politics and problems in the region.&rdquo;</p>

					<small>&ldquo;Brazil’s current IP system severely underregulates the protection of indigenous knowledge, which has led to a particularly high number of instances of biopiracy in the Amazon. One of the most serious deficiencies is the fact that Brazil does not allow patents on plants, only transgenic microorganisms; Brazil also makes no provisions for biological material removed from the country to be used in other countries. This leads to companies using “virtual patents” on biological products; if a researcher discovers a process with a specific product, then they patent the process; this means that they have a virtual patent on the product as well, even if it has no application relevant to the process (Hathaway, 2004).&rdquo;</small>

					<p>&ldquo;Biopiracy is not a new issue in Brazil, and it will continue to be a problem if their policy solutions continue to remain unenforced and mired down in political conflict. This means that <emx>indigenous groups who have used natural resources for years will not see benefits from their discoveries</emx> and large corporations will continue to abuse the Amazon to succeed on the global market.&rdquo;</p>

					<p>&ldquo;In 1876, [Henry Wickham] stole thousands of rubber plant seeds, which he then shipped to England.There was technically no law at the time preventing the export of the seeds, but Wickham had applied for an export license under false pretenses. He smuggled the tens of thousands of seeds back to England in the hold of a steam ship. Each seed was about three-quarters of an inch long. His entire seed cache weighed over 1,000 pounds. And he may not have known it at the time, but this act of biopiracy would totally transform the global rubber trade.&rdquo;
