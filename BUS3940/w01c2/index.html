					Hymn to the Amazon (1868)

						Contemporary Amazonian literature has as its genesis the year 1868, when Fabriciano Hernàndez composed his Hymn to the Amazon (the first with this title and inspiration), twenty- two years before Carlos German Amezaga (1862-1906) was to write his famous Hymn to Brazil ( 1890)(1) as an homage to the first anniversary of the establishment of the Republic in that country, and which turned out to be a tribute to the Amazon River on the strength of these well-known verses in currency among the people

					To the Marañon (1942)  
					by Miguel A. Rojas
					
					Oh, Marañon, sovereign in outpouring motion  
					who in the summits of the Ande you are crowned  
					and flow on, lapping up our nectar, then are bound  
					from here to sweet'ning the Atlantic Ocean
					
					Wherefore in your heinous gullet you've ingested  
					the troubadour so tender, of the Amazon?  
					Did you wish him your hoarded gold thus dropped upon,  
					a fitting tomb, where the gallant bard be rested?
					
					Hail, O giant, your majesty torrential  
					you who swell as through Andean peaks you wend  
					and your kisses bathe my fatherland's terrains!
					
					Of the precious poet of your brawn's potential,  
					of Fabriciano Hernandez, our inspired friend,  
					miser that you are! you're hoarding the remains!

						Miguel A. Rojas is the author of the previously mentioned sonnet, To the Marañon,(9) where he gives that river a lyrical scolding for the tragic death of the poet Fabriciano Hernandez. This sonnet was published in the Review Trocha 5, (Iquitos, 1942) as an "anonymous contribution and a "literary oddity."
						
						 Thirty three years later, in 1975, Izquierdo Rios himself, in his volume Pueblo y bosquel(10) ["People and Forest"] brought to light, without any other information, the name of the sonnet's author, the doctor and poet Miguel A. Rojas. Rios reprinted the poem with variations in some verses and in the final tercet, taking it from an original that an acquaintance of Dr. Rojas had given him.
						 
						 The variants of the new version of this sonnet are the following: in the second verse it reads "up yonder midst the summits you are crowned"; in the tenth verse the singular "Ande" is used; and the last tercet has been exchanged for "Of he who admired your push and power / of he who praised your queenly glory grand / miserly you hoard the precious bones."
						 
						 Miguel A. Rojas, the son of Tomas Rojas and Carmen Mesia, was born in Chachapoyas on February 17, 1862. He received his primary schooling in his native city and secondary education at the "Porvenir de la juventud" ["The Future of Youth"] private school in Lima, headed by clergyman Juan de la Cruz Rolando, where he was sent by his parents at the age of eleven.
						 
						 He enrolled in the Universidad Nacional Mayor de San Marcos to study medicine, and when still a student at San Fernando he enlisted in the service to defend the capital from the threat of Chilean occupation. On that occasion he was assigned to the San Bartolome hospital as an emergency- service surgical assistant for the war-wounded from the battles of Chorrillos, San Juan and Miraflores.(11) He took his degree in medicine in 1886 and hardly having graduated, he was called to practice his profession in an Asian worker camp on the Chicama estate in Trujillo. In 1887 he went to Chachapoyas as a full-time physician. There in 1890, the tragic death of poet Fabriciano Hernandez, a first bard of the Amazon, moved Rojas to write the above-mentioned sonnet, To the Marañòn, which is of special interest in the development of Amazonian literature.
						 
						 In his native city he was also professor of the Seminary School, where Horacio Urteaga, who went on to became a notable historian and Dean of the School of Letters in San Marcos, was his student. In 1891 he was elected deputy Representative by the province of Bongara. He then resided for eight years in Cajmarca, practicing his medical profession (1891-1898). A sonnet of his, written in 1896 and transcribed by Carlos E. Paz Soldan in La Reforma Medica (1946), dates from this period. The poem's tercets contain an accomplished metaphor of human life and destiny:
						 
						 Man is not the water drop unsullied, pure,  
						 that comes falling down from up above on high  
						 to plunge headlong in the lowly filth of swamp;
						 
						 he is the drop, turned mist, that from slime endures,  
						 up ever higher, pure, crystalline will fly  
						 to the cloud that thunderclaps in booming pomp.(12)
						 
						 Before putting down roots in Iquitos around 1900, Miguel A. Rojas practiced his profession, en passant, in the cities of Moyobamba, Tarapoto and Yurimaguas. Once in Iquitos, he was elected Municipal Alderman, eventually assuming the complete mayoral duties in that city. His name appears among those in attendance at a farewell banquet that the Iquitos community held on March 23, 1906(13) for the Department Prefect, Don Hildebrando Fuentes.
						 
						 In 1907, elected by popular vote, he occupied a seat in the Senate of the Republic, representing Loreto. Important public works in the city of Iquitos are tied to Manuel A. Rojas' municipal and parliamentary endeavors, including the installation of wireless telegraph communication services, city sanitation, the establishment of an experimental agricultural station and an industrial school, the paving of the first block of Raimondi Street with imported stones, and the construction of the Santa Rosa hospital and Matriz Church.
						 
						 In the intellectual milieu of the Loreto capital, Miguel A. Rojas made known his oratorical and lyrical gifts by celebrating with rhetorical gallantry in the public forums he took part in, capturing both the heroic and noble soul of the native men and the exotic beauty of the jungle woman. There is a brief journalistic chronicle and a comic poem by Monsieur Treville (Romulo Paredes) that celebrate this intellectual quality of Miguel A. Rojas (l4). Some writings by this doctor-poet are published in Iquitos' El oriente under the nom de plume of "Mar", an acronym of his name. In a long composition of a romantic and celebratory bent, Flor de la selva [ "Flower of the Jungle"], Miguel A. Rojas set down in words an elegy to the Amazonian woman, waxing epithetic and metaphoric, as we can see in this passage:


    Like a bud enfolded midst brocades,
    thus were you born, o chimeric flower!
    mid the sky's red blushes, fleshed,
    and the gilded clouds that tint
    these exultant junqles' sky.
    In these abounding forests of plenty,
    here you were born, prodigious flower;
    here, under this luciferous vault,
    where in hymns of vibratory strophes
    and a sun sparkling at the gentle touch,
    from resplendent, fertile Nature,
    bursts out in blooming song to life.(15)

After many years of residence in Iquitos, Miguel A. Rojas was in Mollendo and Arequipa, where he made the social rounds and shared in literary activities with Jorge Polar and Juan Jose Reynoso. In 1924 he took up permanent residence in Lima. On June 6, 1934, he became a member of the National Academy of Medicine with a first-rate speech, "Reflections on the Medical Ideal", which he expanded into a book, El ideal medico y el medico ideal [ "The Medical Ideal and the Ideal Doctor"], published in 1943, wherein he offers a series of essays expanding on his own reflections, and confrontations between his book learning and his knowledge gained from the experience of a long, sixty-year professional career.

On March 10, 1946, Miguel A. Rojas paid tribute publicly to another great physician of his generation, Leonidas Avendano, who died that year. This homage is published in a pamphlet(l6). In September of that same year, the Peruvian History of Medicine Society in turn honored Rojas in a public meeting. The speeches from this tribute are published in the review La Reforma Medica, 483 (1946)(17). Miguel A. Rojas died in Lima on December 6, 1949, leaving an unfinished book, Elogio de la sordera ["In Praise of Deafness"], though it tortured him in his waning days. To commemorate and memorialize his passing, Carlos Enrique Paz Soldan published an article in La Crònica (12.11.49)(18). A selection of the speeches, poems and thoughts of Miguel A. Rojas was put out in 1974 by Gustavo Collantes Pizarro (l9). Hernàn Monzante Rubio has also issued an homage to this Amazonian author.

The sonnet To the Maranon was read by its author following his prayer In Memoriam, delivered on August 24, 1890, at the memorial for Fabriciano Hernandez. The poem and speech prompted the high ecclesiastical authority, the Bishop of Chachapoyas, Fray Francisco Solano Risco, to attempto to excommunicate him. The bishop's unwonted attitude piqued the people/s curiosity and the poem began to circulate from hand to hand, which explains the two versions that reached Francisco Izquierdo Rìos, the former in 1942, published in Trocha 5, and the latter in 1975, appearing in Pueblo y bosque.
